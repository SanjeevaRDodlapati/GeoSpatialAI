# Project 5: Species Occurrence Mapping - Expansion Analysis
**Completion Rate:** 85.7%

## Scope Expansion Opportunities
### Species Coverage
**Current:** 6 Madagascar endemic species
**Expansion opportunities:**
- Include all Madagascar vertebrates (~300+ species)
- Add invertebrate groups (butterflies, beetles)
- Extend to other biodiversity hotspots (Philippines, Madagascar neighbors)

### Temporal Analysis
**Current:** Static occurrence mapping (2000-2024)
**Expansion opportunities:**
- Time-series analysis for population trends
- Seasonal occurrence patterns
- Climate change impact assessment over decades

### Environmental Variables
**Current:** Synthetic elevation, temperature, precipitation
**Expansion opportunities:**
- Real climate data (WorldClim, CHELSA)
- Land cover change time series
- Human impact layers (roads, settlements, agriculture)

### Species Distribution Modeling
**Current:** Occurrence mapping and density analysis
**Expansion opportunities:**
- MaxEnt species distribution models
- Ensemble modeling approaches
- Future habitat suitability under climate change

### Conservation Applications
**Current:** Descriptive analysis and hotspot identification
**Expansion opportunities:**
- Protected area gap analysis
- Corridor identification and design
- Threat assessment and vulnerability mapping
