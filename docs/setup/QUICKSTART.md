# Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with the Geospatial Tutorial

Congratulations! Your geospatial environment is now set up and ready to use. Here's how to get started:

## Environment Status âœ…

Your environment includes:
- **Python 3.11.6** in a dedicated virtual environment
- **22 geospatial libraries** successfully installed
- **Jupyter Lab/Notebook** ready to use
- **Custom kernel** registered as "Geospatial Python"

## Starting Your First Project

### Option 1: Using Jupyter Notebook
```bash
# Activate environment (if not already active)
source geospatial_env/bin/activate

# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

# Navigate to: projects/project_0_cartography_practice/notebooks/
# Open: cartography_practice.ipynb
# Select kernel: "Geospatial Python"
```

### Option 2: Using JupyterLab
```bash
# Activate environment (if not already active)  
source geospatial_env/bin/activate

# Start JupyterLab
jupyter lab

# Open the project notebook and select "Geospatial Python" kernel
```

### Option 3: Using the Activation Script
```bash
# Run the activation script
source activate_env.sh

# Then launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

## Your First Steps

1. **Start with Project 0** - Cartography Practice
   - Location: `projects/project_0_cartography_practice/notebooks/cartography_practice.ipynb`
   - This validates your setup and teaches cartography basics

2. **Follow the learning path**:
   - Project 0: Cartography & Projections âœ… Ready
   - Project 1: Census Demographic Mapping ðŸ“‹ Planned  
   - Project 2: Street Networks & Walkability ðŸ“‹ Planned
   - Project 3: Air Quality Analysis ðŸ“‹ Planned
   - Project 4: Land Cover Analysis ðŸ“‹ Planned
   - Project 5: Species Occurrence Mapping ðŸ“‹ Planned
   - Project 6: Hazard Exposure Analysis ðŸ“‹ Planned

## Important Notes

### Kernel Selection
When opening notebooks in Jupyter:
1. Go to **Kernel** â†’ **Change kernel** â†’ **Geospatial Python**
2. This ensures you're using the correct environment with all packages

### Environment Activation
Always activate your environment before working:
```bash
cd /Users/sanjeevadodlapati/Downloads/Repos/GeoSpatial
source geospatial_env/bin/activate
```

### File Organization
Each project follows this structure:
```
project_name/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ raw/           # Downloaded data (keep unchanged)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ interim/       # Cleaned data  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ processed/     # Analysis-ready data
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/         # Jupyter notebooks
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ figures/       # Maps and plots
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tables/        # Summary tables
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ maps/          # GIS outputs
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Troubleshooting

### If packages are missing:
```bash
source geospatial_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### If Jupyter kernel is not available:
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name geospatial --display-name "Geospatial Python"
```

### Test your environment anytime:
```bash
python test_environment.py
```

## Next Steps

1. **Explore Project 0** - Start with the cartography practice notebook
2. **Download Natural Earth data** - The notebook will guide you through this
3. **Create your first maps** - Learn projections and cartographic design
4. **Move to Project 1** - Apply skills to real Census data analysis

## Getting Help

- Check the detailed `INSTALLATION.md` for setup issues
- Each project has its own detailed README
- All code includes extensive comments and explanations
- Quality assurance checklists help ensure success
