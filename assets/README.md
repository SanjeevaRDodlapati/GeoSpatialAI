## Strategic Visual Approach

The dual-image strategy serves different audiences and project phases:

1. **Head Image 1** (Data Analysis):
   - Immediately establishes technical credibility
   - Appeals to data scientists and GIS professionals
   - Shows the analytical foundation of the platform
   - Represents Phase 1: Foundation Projects

2. **Head Image 2** (Conservation):
   - Emphasizes real-world conservation impact
   - Appeals to conservation practitioners and stakeholders
   - Shows the applied research outcomes
   - Represents Phase 2: Research Applications

This approach effectively communicates both the technical rigor and practical conservation impact of the platform.
