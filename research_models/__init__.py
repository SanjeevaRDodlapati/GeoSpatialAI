Research Models Development
==========================

Simple, clean development space for open source model research.
No packaging, no complex imports - just straightforward development.

Development Approach:
- Start with simple scripts that work
- Build models one by one
- Test each component independently  
- No complex packaging until everything works
- Focus on functionality over structure
