## ⚠️ Why Suggested Platforms Fail Our Requirements

### 🚫 **Hugging Face Spaces - COMPLETELY INADEQUATE**

**Fundamental Mismatches:**
- ❌ **Single Container Limit**: Can't deploy our 9-service ecosystem
- ❌ **No Database Support**: No PostgreSQL for conservation data persistence  
- ❌ **No Message Queues**: No Redis for inter-service communication
- ❌ **No File Storage**: No MinIO for satellite imagery and ML models
- ❌ **No Orchestration**: No Kubernetes-style service coordination
- ❌ **Public Only**: Conservation data requires private deployment
- ❌ **Resource Limits**: Cannot handle our 2-4GB memory per service requirements

**Our Evidence:**
```yaml
# Our ecosystem requires:
- ecosystem-orchestrator: 2GB RAM, 1.5 CPU cores
- conservation-dashboard: 2GB RAM, 1.5 CPU cores  
- threat-detection-agent: 3GB RAM, 1.5 CPU cores
- species-identification-agent: 3GB RAM, 1.5 CPU cores
- postgresql: 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores
- Total: 14GB RAM, 9.5 CPU cores minimum
```

### 🚫 **Streamlit Community Cloud - INSUFFICIENT**

**Critical Limitations:**
- ❌ **Dashboard Only**: Cannot deploy our orchestrator and agents
- ❌ **No Inter-Service Communication**: No way to connect multiple microservices
- ❌ **No Database**: Cannot persist conservation monitoring data
- ❌ **No Real-Time Processing**: Cannot handle satellite imagery analysis
- ❌ **Single Process**: Our ecosystem requires coordinated multi-agent system

### 🚫 **PythonAnywhere - TOO LIMITED**

**Blocking Issues:**
- ❌ **CPU/Memory Caps**: Free tier insufficient for ML workloads
- ❌ **No Container Support**: Cannot deploy our Docker ecosystem
- ❌ **No Kubernetes**: Cannot orchestrate our microservices
- ❌ **No Auto-Scaling**: Cannot handle variable conservation workloads
