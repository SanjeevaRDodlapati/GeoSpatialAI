# üåç Global Conservation AI System

## Overview
The Global Conservation AI System is a comprehensive platform for real-time conservation monitoring and analysis using global datasets and AI-powered evaluation. The system connects to multiple real-world APIs to provide location-specific conservation intelligence for any point on Earth.

## Key Features
- **üåé Global Coverage**: Monitor and analyze conservation data for any location worldwide
- **üîÑ Real-time Data**: Direct integration with live conservation databases and satellite imagery
- **ü§ñ AI Analysis**: 6 specialized AI agents for comprehensive conservation assessment
- **üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map**: Click anywhere on Earth to analyze specific locations
- **üìä Multi-API Integration**: Connected to GBIF, NASA FIRMS, eBird, USGS, and other data sources

## System Components
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Web interface with map and action buttons
- **Real API Wrappers**: Direct connections to global conservation databases
- **Web Server**: Backend for handling API requests and responses
- **AI Analysis Agents**: Specialized models for different conservation tasks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- API keys for specific services (see `api_key_setup_guide.py`)

### Running the System
1. Start the web server:
   ```bash
   python traced_web_server.py
   ```

2. Open the dashboard in your web browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. Click any location on the global map to analyze conservation status

4. Use action buttons to trigger specialized analyses:
   - üö® Emergency Response
   - üîç Species Monitoring
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Threat Scanning

### Testing Global Capability
To verify the system works globally, run:
```bash
python test_global_capability.py
```

This script tests conservation analysis at famous global locations including:
- Amazon Rainforest, Brazil
- Yellowstone National Park, USA
- Serengeti National Park, Tanzania
- Great Barrier Reef, Australia
- Borneo Rainforest, Indonesia
- Gal√°pagos Islands, Ecuador

## API Integration
The system connects to multiple real-world conservation APIs:

1. **GBIF** (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)
   - 120M+ global species records
   - Location-specific biodiversity data

2. **NASA FIRMS** (Fire Information for Resource Management System)
   - Real-time fire detection from satellites
   - Global coverage with 375m resolution

3. **eBird**
   - Global bird observation database
   - Citizen science data from worldwide contributors

4. **USGS** (United States Geological Survey)
   - Earthquake monitoring
   - Land cover analysis

5. **Sentinel Hub**
   - Satellite imagery
   - 10m resolution global coverage

6. **NOAA & NASA Earthdata**
   - Climate and weather data
   - Global environmental monitoring

## System Architecture
- **Frontend**: Interactive web interface with Leaflet map integration
- **Backend**: Python-based web server handling API requests
- **Data Layer**: Real API wrappers connecting to global conservation databases
- **AI Layer**: Conservation analysis agents processing real-world data

## Usage Examples

### Location-Based Analysis
Click anywhere on the global map to receive:
- Species occurrence data for that specific location
- Biodiversity scores based on actual species records
- Habitat assessment using satellite data
- Threat evaluation from multiple environmental indicators

### Emergency Response
Trigger comprehensive emergency analysis with:
- Real-time fire detection within selected coordinates
- Critical species identification in affected areas
- Resource allocation recommendations
- Priority action plans based on threat severity

### Species Monitoring
Start detailed species monitoring to receive:
- Current biodiversity index for selected location
- List of detected species with conservation status
- Population trend analysis
- Conservation recommendations

## Troubleshooting
- Check API key configuration in .env file
- Verify internet connection for real-time data access
- Ensure all Python dependencies are installed
- See logs in terminal for detailed error information

## Future Enhancements
- Mobile application for field researchers
- Machine learning for predictive conservation alerts
- Integration with drone imagery for higher resolution data
- Expanded AI capabilities for policy recommendations
